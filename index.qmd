### Nibia Becerra Santillan

**Pronouns:** *she/her*

**Education:** Macalester College, B.A. Biology and Statistics

**Short Bio:** My passion lies in translating scientific knowledge into actionable solutions with real-world impact. With my strong theoretical foundation and hands-on experience, I aspire to bridge the gap between responsible, community-based science and practical projects that directly benefit people. As a problem solver with a global perspective and a relational approach to finding solutions, I work well in collaborative environments and care deeply about building meaningful connections within a team. I bring a thoughtful and creative approach to challenges and I am excited to share my experiences, support others in their goals, and help create a space where impactful, actionable ideas can grow.
